# Writing Style Guide

## Core principles

1. **Be clear and concise**
2. **Avoid unnecessary bias**
3. **Use appropriate language**
4. **Use correct spelling, punctuation and grammar**
5. **Do not plagiarise**

### 1. Be clear and concise

Avoid excessively wordy or ambiguous language; the sentence should be clear to
understand, even for a non-native speaker.

- **Avoid unexplained jargon or unknown acronyms**

Explain jargon which the average player would not understand. Do not abbreviate
or use acronyms unless the acronym is widely accepted. Avoid textspeak (e.g.
TTYL).

| Avoid                                                                                                | Prefer                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _The project is managed over GH to provide a centralised repository for synchronised collaboration._ | **The project is managed over GitHub to provide a central place to work together.**                                                                                                                             |
| _The mod makes heavy use of Mixins and access wideners._                                             | **The mod makes use of Mixins (which allow the developer's code to be injected into the game) and access wideners (which allow the developer to access parts of the game code which are normally restricted).** |

- **Avoid ambiguous language or pronouns**

It should be clear what every clause of a sentence is referring to.

| Avoid                                                 | Prefer                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Jim met a man on the hill. He had a big green coat._ | **Jim met a man on the hill, who had a big green coat.** or **Jim, who had a big green coat, met a man on the hill** |

- **Avoid being excessively wordy**

Use simpler language where possible; it does not matter if it sounds less
sophisticated.

| Avoid                                                                | Prefer                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| _I bought a dog for the purpose of providing me with companionship._ | **I bought a dog for companionship.**          |
| _In my own personal opinion, ..._                                    | **In my opinion, ...** or **I think that ...** |

### 2. Avoid unnecessary bias

- **Avoid editorialising**

In articles that are supposed to be factual and/or informative (such as
tutorials, interviews, or reviews), avoid editorialising. Stating opinions in
reviews is obviously acceptable.

| Avoid                                                               | Prefer                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In a news article: _The immoral organisation $X was involved in..._ | **$X was involved in...** (let the reader decide what they think about it) |

- **Avoid biased language**

Avoid using language which is needlessly gendered or otherwise presents a
linguistic bias towards a group. The exception to this is to avoid
**person-first language**, which can often lead to excessively wordy sentences,
and has been discouraged by
[several advocacy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language#Criticism).

| Avoid                     | Prefer                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Chairman_                | **Chairperson** (if the gender of the individual is not explicitly clear) |
| _A person with blindness_ | **A blind person**                                                        |

### 3. Use appropriate language

Being laidback and fun with the writing style is fine (it is a magazine, after
all), but avoid any of the following:

- Excessive swearing
- Language or humour which could be considered offensive towards a group
- Textspeak (e.g. TTYL)
- Slang or abbreviations

### 4. Use correct spelling, punctuation and grammar

- **All sentences should be syntactically and grammatically correct**

| Avoid                           | Prefer                            |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| _You should of gone outside._   | **You should have gone outside.** |
| _She's married with a dentist._ | **She's married to a dentist.**   |

- **In terms of spelling, use British English spelling over American English**

| Avoid        | Prefer                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| _Realize_    | **Realise**                                     |
| _Defense_    | **Defence**                                     |
| _Color_      | **Colour**                                      |
| _TV program_ | **TV programme** (except for computer programs) |
| _Gray_       | **Grey**                                        |

- Use the Oxford comma (putting a comma before the **and** or **or** in a list)

| Avoid                        | Prefer                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| _Apples, bananas or oranges_ | **Apples, bananas, or oranges** |

### 5. Do not plagiarise

Do **not** copy from other sources, and do not use AI such as ChatGPT. AI can
create hard to follow writing pieces and will not allow each writer to have
their own signature style.

## Additional Notes

### Markdown

Markdown will be automatically formatted to our standards if your contribution
is merged, so there is no need to worry about formatting.

### Sources

If you use external sources (which most articles will), please make sure to cite
these sources using Markdown footnotes. A tutorial on using footnotes in
Markdown can be found
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes).

In general, citations should follow the format of:

- Website: `[URL], [Author?], [Date accessed (DD/MM/YY)]`
- Conversation/Message: `[Author], [Date (DD/MM/YY)]`

### Using Images

If your article uses images, they should be placed within the `[Issue]/assets`
directory, with a descriptive `lower-kebab-case` name, as PNGs.

You should also add a note to `[Issue]/assets/ATTRIBUTION.md`, following the
format used by other entries in the file. If the image is an original that you have created, the author
should be `Original (your username)`. You should maintain the alphabetic
sorting.
