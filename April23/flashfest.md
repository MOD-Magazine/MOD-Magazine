# FlashFest organised for April Foolsâ€™ snapshot

This month of course comes with April Fools' Day, and that means a Minecraft
April Fools' update! In this year's offering we saw a feature in which players
regularly vote on "proposals", each of which would make a small change to the
game, ranging from changing the colour of grass to... turning the game French?
C'est bizarre. Anyway, with this snapshot came an impromptu ModFest, dubbed a
"FlashFest". The competition gave contestants 24 hours to make anything they
could targeting this snapshot. Some of the brilliant and wildly surreal
submissions included a "Bottle of Gender" (what), a mod that allows proposals to
be converted to items, and then shot out of a gun (???) and a mod with a
proposal which instils a sudden generosity into villagers, making them offer all
trades for free (the most unrealistic one by far). The competition was a great
success, and we hope to see more of these FlashFests in the future - if you want
to see all the submissions, go and check out ModFest's Discord
