1. Sodium, Iris, and ModMenu - amongst other smaller mods - archived some or all
   of their files, and changed their descriptions to redirect users to Modrinth.
2. Sodium and Iris are deleted from Curseforge by the moderators, breaking every
   modpack. The creators originally only archived their files rather than
   deleting them to maintain modpack functionality. Sodium is given the message
   'Your project must have files in order to stay live', and wasn't told prior
   to this decision.
3. Sodium is restored, and JellySquid unarchives <=1.18. versions. Iris is not
   restored, as the creators no longer want to use Curseforge.

# IDK

In metal forging news, a collection of large Fabric mods have been jumping ship
from Curseforge. It's really hard to keep up with all this block game drama,
what ever happened to just mining and crafting? Anyway, luckily we are here to
take you through the what and the why of this situation, which has been brewing
for years.

## What?

The big players are Sodium, Iris, and ModMenu, who all removed archived some (or
all) of their Curseforge files around the 16th of April, as well as updating
their descriptions to redirect Modrinth.

Unfortunately, whether it was the decision of a lone moderator or the whole
team, Sodium and Iris were removed from Curseforge without communication with the
developers shortly after discussion about the projects broke out. While the original creators were
willing to compromise by only archiving files (for those unfamiliar, this means
that modpacks that already include the version do not break), Curseforge went
for the nuclear option. This broke almost _all_ Fabric modpacks on the platform;
I'm sure the OptiFabric users were laughing.

Sodium creator JellySquid was able to come to a compromise on top of a
compromise, with Curseforge agreeing that the project could be recovered if
versions for 1.18 and below were restored - the Iris team have decided to not go
forward with Curseforge, and Iris remains unavailable on the platform.

## Why?

So, what's the root cause? Simple; creators feel like Curseforge is not good
enough for both them and their users. On the creator side, Curseforge's project
page is said to have 'massive technical issues' concerning project
management - and the new beta site doesn't seem to improve the situation enough
to outgun other, more modern platforms (_cough_ Modrinth _cough_). With payouts
decreasing as well (although this is regular for the time of year), Iris feels
Modrinth's approach of giving 100% of ad revenue on the project page to creators
is more fitting - the platform is nothing without its creators. They say they
have 'waited long enough for the situation to improve, and it hasn't'.

Meanwhile, regular users will notice:

- The large volume of adverts all over the site (these are hidden from creators).
- The search continues to return unsatisfactory results - although this is
  being worked on.
- The versioning conundrum; snapshots are completely non-granular
  (1.19-Snapshot, not individual versions), and the 1.19.x versions are all
  clumped into one - despite the huge internal refactors making mods
  incompatible with all 1.19 versions.

## What's Next?

Curseforge plans to roll out its beta website on the 18th of April. Many
people are angry that they seem to be rushing out a product which does not even
have full feature parity with the legacy site, but we might see
rapid iterations from the Curseforge team - maybe we'll see another Curseforge
golden age in our lifetimes.
