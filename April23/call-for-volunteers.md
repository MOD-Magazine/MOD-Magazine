title: Call for Volunteers

To conclude our first MOD! Magazine issue, I'd first like to thank the team! We
couldn't have done this with one less person, so thank you for your faith.

With that said, we need you! Do you have free time? Do you enjoy writing,
designing, or brainstorming? We want to grow our volunteer team to improve our
issues. We need:

- Writers

  Writers are in charge of...well writing. You can come up with your own ideas
  or volunteer to write an existing article - all we ask is that you follow our
  writing guidelines and communicate with our editors.

- Designers

  Designers design! We have both the website and the magazine - the website
  isn't ready yet, and the magazine design had to be rushed. Your contributions
  could range from sending back-of-the-napkin concepts to leading the website
  team; if you think you have an eye for design, why not come and help?

- Brainstormers

  We need people in touch with all corners of the community, feeding us news and
  cool things! Coming up with magazine articles takes work, from selecting the
  mods of the month to deciding on the headline article, lots of time is put in.
  We need people to help us come up with these ideas - it can be a casual role!

There are no commitments for these roles. If you only want to write one article
or want a month off, that's fine, just tell us.

So, what do you say? Want to volunteer with us and make something great? Contact
us on Discord at https://mod-magazine.github.io/discord.

P.S: even if you don't want to contribute, you can still come and join the
community :)
