It's time to look at our editor-picked projects of the month! These are a small
selection of our personal favourite projects that came out in April - this is by
no means an exhaustive list, go look for yourself as well!

## [Cobblemon](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon)

OK...so it didn't come out this month...or last month...or the month before
that. Cobblemon came out in October last year, but we wanted to give it a
mention since it has been gaining popularity recently.

## [e4mc](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc)

e4mc actually came out this month, so we're off to a good start. This project is
interesting both technically and for regular players: it allows you to open your
LAN game to the wide world. That doesn't sound very cool, until you learn that
only the host needs e4mc installed. Your friends can connect with a vanilla
client. Gone are the days of those terrible free server hosts. I wish.

When you open a game to LAN, the mod will automatically send you a link in chat;
use it as the server IP in the connect menu, and you're good! On the backend,
e4mc uses a websocket server implemented in Rust, which automatically makes it
blazingly fast and better than every other piece of software ever created (I use
Rust btw).

## [Physics Toys](https://modrinth.com/mod/physics-toys)

This one is seriously cool. Physics Toys lets you play with physics, entirely on the server. I'm not entirely sure what Patbox does to the server
to make it do these things, but I do know that it's awesome. A picture is worth more than a 1000 words:

Server fuelled madness. I, for one, cannot wait to see what the resident server wizard does next.
