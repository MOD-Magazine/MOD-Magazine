title: A Curseforge Dilemma
author: Jamalam

A collection of large Fabric mods have been jumping ship from Curseforge. It's
difficult to keep up with all this block game drama, what ever happened to
just mining and crafting? Anyway, luckily we are here to take you through the
what and the why of this situation, which has been brewing for years.

## What Happened?

The biggest players are Sodium, Iris, and ModMenu, who all removed some
(or all) of their Curseforge files around the 16th of April, as well as updating
their descriptions to redirect to Modrinth.

Whether it was the decision of a lone moderator or the whole team, Sodium and
Iris were quickly removed from Curseforge without substantial communication to the
developers. While the original creators were willing to compromise by only
archiving files (for those unfamiliar, this means that modpacks that already
included the version did not break), Curseforge opted for the nuclear option.
This broke almost _all_ Fabric modpacks on the platform; I'm sure the OptiFabric
users were laughing when Iris ceased to work.

Sodium creator JellySquid reached a compromise on top of a
compromise, by agreeing that the project would be recovered if versions for 1.18
and below were restored - the Iris team made a similar decision.

## Why?

So, what's the root cause? Simple; creators feel like Curseforge is not good
enough for them and their users.

On the creator side, Curseforge's project page is said to have 'massive
technical issues' concerning project management - and the beta site doesn't
seem to improve the situation enough to outgun other, more modern platforms
(_cough_ Modrinth _cough_). With payouts decreasing as well (although this is
somewhat regular for the time of year), Iris feels Modrinth's approach of giving 100% of
ad revenue on the project page to creators is more fitting - the platform is
nothing without its creators.

Meanwhile, regular users will notice:

- The large volume of adverts all over the site (these are hidden from
  creators).
- The search continues to return unsatisfactory results - although this is being
  worked on.
- Snapshots are grouped as one (1.19-Snapshot, not individual snapshots)

## What's Next?

Curseforge released its beta website on the 18th of April. Many people are angry
that they released a product without full feature parity with
the legacy site. Hopefully we will see rapid iterations from the Curseforge team, but for now we just have to wait and see.
