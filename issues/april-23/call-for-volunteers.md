To conclude our first MOD! Magazine issue, I'd first like to thank our tiny
team! We couldn't have done this with one less person, so thank you everyone for
your faith.

With that said, we need _you_! This issue is something of a proof-of-concept to
draw attention to the project; we want to make the best thing we can, and for
that we need more people.

Do you have a bit of free time? Do you enjoy writing, designing, or even just
being a part of a community? We want to grow our volunteer team and community.
We need:

- Writers & Editors

  Writers are in charge of... well, writing. You can come up with your own ideas
  or volunteer to write an pre-defined article - all we ask is that you follow
  our writing guidelines and communicate with our editors. Being an editor is a
  higher level role yet to be defined, but we know it will involve more people
  managing and reviewing.

- Designers

  Designers design! We have both the website and the magazine - the website
  isn't ready yet, and the magazine design had to be rushed. Your contributions
  could range from sending back-of-the-napkin concepts to leading the website
  team; if you think you have an eye for design, why not come and help?

- Anyone at all!

  The community is one of the most important parts of a project like this. We
  need people in touch with all corners of the community, feeding us news and
  cool things! Coming up with magazine articles takes work, from selecting the
  mods of the month to deciding on the headline article, lots of time is put in.
  We need people around to help us by discussing and suggesting!

There are no commitments for these roles. If you only want to write one article
or want a month off, that's fine, just tell us.

So, what do you say? Want to volunteer with us and make something great? Contact
