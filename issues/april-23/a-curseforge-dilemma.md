A collection of large Fabric mods have been jumping ship from Curseforge. It's
difficult to keep up with all this block game drama, what ever happened to just
mining and crafting? Anyway, we are here to take you through the what and the
why of this situation, which has been brewing for years.

## What Happened?

The biggest players are Sodium, Iris, and ModMenu, who all removed some (or all)
of their Curseforge files around the 16th of April, as well as updating their
descriptions to redirect to Modrinth.

Whether it was the decision of a lone moderator or the whole team, Sodium and
Iris were quickly removed from Curseforge without substantial communication to
their developers. While the original creators were willing to compromise by only
archiving files (for those unfamiliar, this means that modpacks that already
included the version would not break), Curseforge opted for the nuclear option.
This broke almost _all_ Fabric modpacks on the platform; I'm sure the OptiFabric
users were laughing when Iris ceased to work.

JellySquid, the creator of Sodium, reached a compromise on top of a compromise,
agreeing to restore versions for 1.18 and below for the project to be recovered.
The Iris team made a similar decision.

## Why?

So, what's the root cause? Simple - creators feel like Curseforge is not good
enough for them and their users.

On the creator side, Curseforge's project page is said to have 'massive
technical issues' concerning project management - and the beta site doesn't seem
to improve the situation enough to outgun other, more modern platforms (_cough_
Modrinth _cough_). With payouts decreasing as well (although this is somewhat
usual for the time of year), the Iris team feels Modrinth's approach of giving
100% of ad revenue on the project page to creators is better - the platform is
nothing without its creators.

> We've waited long enough for the situation to improve, and it hasn't - _Iris
> Developers_

Meanwhile, users of the website keep having the same issues they've been having
for years:

- The large volume of adverts all over the site (which creators don't see).
- The search continues to return unsatisfactory results - although this is being
  worked on.
- Snapshots are grouped as one (1.19-Snapshot, not individual snapshots)

## What's Next?

Curseforge fully released their new website on the 18th of April. Many people
are dissapointed that it still doesn't have feature parity with the legacy site.
Hopefully we'll be seeing rapid iterations from the Curseforge team to improve
user experience on the platform, but for now we just have to wait and see.
