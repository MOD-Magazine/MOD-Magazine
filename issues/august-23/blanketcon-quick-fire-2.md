This article is the second in a series of 'quick-fire' articles on projects at [BlanketCon 23](https://blanketcon.modfest.net).

These lists are in no particular order and mods haven't been chosen based on any particular criteria. While we will do our best to cover as much as possible, we really recommend joining the server to explore for yourself.
