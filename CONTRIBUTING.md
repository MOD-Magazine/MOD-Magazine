_[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MOD-Magazine/MOD-Magazine/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)_


Thank you for your interest in contributing to MOD!. We recommend reaching out [over Discord](https://discord.gg/mNQhSt6xY2) before sending any pull requests, so we can check your idea fits with our plans. You can contribute in a variety of ways:

- Writing articles.
- Collecting information for articles (e.g. reviews), without the commitment of having to write them yourself.
- [The website](https://github.com/MOD-Magazine/mod-magazine.github.io).
- Design.

## Writing

_[Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/MOD-Magazine/MOD-Magazine/blob/main/WRITING-STYLE-GUIDE.md)_

Our articles are written in Markdown, and will be collated into the magazine by the editors - this means the writers only have to focus on writing the article! Please make sure you read the style guide linked above and make sure to send your article in the a `lower-kebab-case.md` file in the relevant issue folder

Images and other content can be put in the `/<issue folder>/assets` directory. Please make sure you include a copyright/attribution notice if necessary, in the `ATTRIBUTION.md` file 

### Layout

Each (usually monthly) issue of the magazine contains several different sections (which are not necessarily physically divided):

- Reviews
- New content/things to look out for
- Long form articles
- News
