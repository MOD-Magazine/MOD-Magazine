# Contributing to MOD! Magazine

_[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MOD-Magazine/MOD-Magazine/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)_

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MOD!. We recommend reaching out [over Discord](https://discord.gg/mNQhSt6xY2) before sending any pull requests, so we can check your idea fits with our plans. You can contribute in a variety of ways:

- Writing articles, or taking on a larger role as an editor.
- Collecting information or informing for articles (e.g. reviews), without the commitment of having to write them yourself.
- [The website](https://github.com/MOD-Magazine/mod-magazine.github.io).
- Design.

## Writing

_[Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/MOD-Magazine/MOD-Magazine/blob/main/WRITING-STYLE-GUIDE.md)_

Our articles are written in Markdown, and will be collated into the magazine by the editors - this means the writers only have to focus on writing the article! Please make sure you read the style guide linked above, then copy `article-template.md` into a `lower-kebab-case-article-name.md` file in the relevant issue folder. Fill in the frontmatter in the template, then get started writing. Additionally, please make sure you have:

1. Discussed the article with us before submitting your pull request.
2. Created an issue and been assigned to it before submitting your pull request.
3. Make sure you link your issue and pull request.

Images and other content can be put in the `/<issue folder>/assets` directory. Please make sure you include a copyright/attribution notice if necessary, in the `ATTRIBUTION.md` file 

### Layout

Each (usually monthly) issue of the magazine contains several different sections (which are not necessarily physically divided):

- Reviews
- New content/things to look out for ('Mods of the Month')
- Long form articles
- News
